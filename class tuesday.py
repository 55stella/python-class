#def function_name():
    #block of code
    #function_name()#calling the function to do something.
    #a function that changes first name to last name.

    #in function an argument is defined as whatever is beeing passed inside 
    # a parenthesis when defining a function
    #argument is what you use when you want to call the function
    #def add_num(x,y):
        #print(x+y)
        #add_num(2,4)
        #return statement.used to return output of a function.
        #return gives the ability to save it to a variable

# def add_num(x,y):
#     a = x +y

# def add_num2(x,y):
#     a= x+y
#     return a

        
# a = add_num(2,4)# this will return none bcause its not returning anithing.so it doesnt give you the ability to return anthing.
# b = add_num2(2,4)#this would return 6 because we said return x+y
# print(a)
# print(b)

#anything after the return statement will not work.
#arbitrary argumenrt is used when we dont kmow the ampount of argument we will need
